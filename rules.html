	  <h1>General</h1>

	  <hr>

	  <h2>Do not share your account information with others</h2>
	  <p>Any rules broken under your account, even if someone else is using it, will result in the appropriate punishment. If we find you were using another account to break rules, the main account will be punished too.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Do not attempt to circumvent a punishment</h2>
	  <p>Your ability to play or chat on our Minecraft servers have been revoked (as a punishment) because you have broken the rules. If the punishment was temporary, our assumption is that by revoking these abilities will encourage you to follow the rules in the future, when the punishment expires. Bypassing the punishment will not serve to encourage you to follow the rules in the future. This will result in a similar punishment to that account.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Do not use hacks / client side cheats (Includes external software like autoclickers, or cheats you can do in vanilla, like X-Ray resource packs, etcâ€¦)</h2>
	  <p>You can use Quality of Life mods, like Performance enhancing mods, minimaps, schematics, but not cheats, because they provide a unfair advantage over the players who don't use them.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Do not intentionally lag the server</h2>
	  <p>This creates a unplayable experience for everyone.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Do not sell in game items for Real life money</h2>
	  <p>This includes selling items for crypto-currency.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Do not exploit bugs</h2>
	  <p>These bugs usually harm both the players and the server itself. If you find any bug, please report it!</p>

	  <h2>Do not create items with inappropiate names</h2>
	  <p>Players should have the option to not see inappropiate content, and we can't censor items.</p>

	  <h2>You may only have 2 alternate accounts</h2>
	  <p>Alts can give players an unfair advantage to the owner of said alt. If you plan on using them actively, you must tell the players (and staff) that you own that account.</p>

	  <hr>

	  <h1>Chat</h1>
	  
	  <hr>

	  <h2>Do not advertise other servers or product. You can talk about other servers by name</h2>
	  <p>It is not in our interest for our users to be indulging with other (potentially harmful) Minecraft servers or products. Additionally, we do not wish for chat to be filled with advertisements.</p>
    
	  <h2>Do not post content that promotes violence or self harm in chat, signs, books, etc...</h2>
	  <p>We want everyone to be in a safe enviroment. Promotion of these goes against them</p>

	  <h2>No spamming</h2>
	  <p>This means sending several messages (+3) with really similar (or the same) content, or sending the same message every so often. This makes it hard for players to have a conversation in chat.</p>
	  
	  <h2>No harassing other players</h2>
	  <p>We wish to maintain a friendly and welcoming environment for all users. Inappropriate behavior toward other players is counterproductive to this goal. We define harassment as: posting or threatening to post anyone's personal information, targeting someone for their race/religion/ethnicity/sexuality, extreme "name-calling", requesting someone to inflict self harm, or in-game stalking or repetitive annoyances to said person.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Do not post inflamatory speech against some minorities</h2>
	  <p>We wish to maintain a friendly and welcoming environment for all users. Things such as racism, homophobia, sexism and other kinds of inflamatory speech can make everybody uncomfortable and doesn't create a welcoming enviroment.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Do not post excessive NSFW content in any form</h2>
	  <p>While we allow curse words in our chat, we don't allow these kinds of discussions in our server, as it can make users uncomfortable. We allow some references, but not full blown discussions of NSFW concepts.</p>

	  <hr>

	  <h1>Griefing and Theft</h1>
	  
	  <hr>

	  <h2>Griefing of any kind is not allowed</h2>
	  <p>We want players be able to express their creativity without having to worry about griefers.</p>
	
	  <h2>If a build looks abandoned and is not close to another claim, you can destroy / loot it</h2>
	  <p>If it's close to another claim, DO NOT TOUCH IT. This is our only exception to the griefing rule.</p>

	  <h2>Do not go out of your way when you're allowed to grief</h2>
	  <p>If you're allowed to grief because it looks abandoned, do not go out of your way to make it ugly (random blocks / liquids, fire, etc...).</p>

	  <h2>Theft of any kind is not allowed</h2>
	  <p>The only exception is to a player who has been inactive for a long time (+45 days)</p>

	  <h2>Getting the items of a killed player is allowed when the fight was in a PvP area</h2>
	  <p>If you kill a player through legal ways (Plain old PvP), you can legally keep all the loot (although we recommend to give it back).</p>

	  <h2>Assasination of mobs in claims is not allowed</h2>
	  <p>Mobs are meant to be a part of a town, and killing them is considered a form of griefing.</p>

	  <hr>

	  <h1>Builds</h1>

	  <hr>

	  <h2>Do not alter the surface of the map significally</h2>
	  <p>We want to keep the exterior part of the map as good as possible, you may make enormous builds on the exterior and deforestate an area, but do not make a huge hole or blow a mountain. You can do anything on the interior.</p>

	  <h2>You may only make Maparts in the open sea</h2>
	  <p>We want to keep the land of our server as clean as possible, and maparts significally alter the land.</p>

	  <h2>Breaking spawners is not allowed </h2>
	  <p>For us to add vanilla structures, we need to use spawners for the mob spawns, so breaking them would remove the ability to make a farm</p>

	  <hr>

	  <h1>PvP</h1>

	  <hr>

	  <h2>Combat logging in a fight with another player is not allowed</h2>
	  <p>Combat logging is an unfair way to avoid a combat situation.</p>

	  <h2>Do not trap a player if they're currently trapped in that town</h2>
	  <p>Since outlawed players can't tp out of the town, this would be unfair for the player.</p>

	  <h2>Do not trap a player in a way they can't escape by their own means</h2>
	  <p>Players shouldn't need staff intervention to get out of a trap.</p>

	  <h2>Do not use other means to kill a player in a zone without PvP on</h2>
	  <p>This includes using lava, cacti, making a new claim with pvp, etc... to kill a player.</p>

	  <hr>

	  <h1>PvP</h1>

	  <hr>

	  <h2>Do not create a town just to annoy another town</h2>
	  <p>This means blocking another town's growth, claiming stuff they were already planning to claim. etc...</p>

	  <h2>Towns and nations can have any name as long they're appropiate</h2>
	  <p>We want to keep all of our towns with an appropiate name.</p>

	  <h2>Towns and nations shouldn't have a really similar name to another town or nation</h2>
	  <p>You shouldn't be able to confuse between 2 towns or nations.</p>
